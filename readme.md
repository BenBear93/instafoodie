Low Wei De Project 2 - Insta Foodie 
Technologies used during this project were Sublime text editor, Bootstrap, Express, React, Postgres and Heroku

Approach taken - First i design the layout and pages i want to have for my app. Then, i start to draw out the components and required functions for them. Thereafter, i also draw the flow of the data being passed through and required. 

I started my project by building the basic pages and required routes. Thereafter, i introduced the other components and functions. Along the way, i also frequently console log the required data so as to ease the process of debugging. 

Installation instructions - installing of express, react, bootstrap, postgres and Heroku

Unsolved problems - Yet to introduce search function, sort function and also the ability for users to comment on each other posts.
